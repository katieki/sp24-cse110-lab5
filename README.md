*Check Your Understanding*\
1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application, because unit tests are used to test individual parts of code and cannot test how these individual components interact with each other. Since a "message" feature will likely involve interactions between various components of the application, the unit test would not be productive.
2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of the message application, since the "max message length" feature preventing the user from typing more than 80 characters is suitable to test for in isolation.
